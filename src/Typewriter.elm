are _deleted_. For that, see [`withBackspaceDelay`](#withBackspaceDelay).

{-| Provide a generator that produces floats, that will be used to calculate the delay
in the next step of the typing process. The float is used as a coefficient with the delay
configured for that step.

If generator produces `0.5`, then the next step will be twice as fast. Conversely, if it
were to produce `2.0`, then that next step will take twice as long.
